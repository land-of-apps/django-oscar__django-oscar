### Design the Invocation of the Coupon.io Web Service

---

**Problem**

When a user adds an item to the shopping cart, there is no integration with the Coupon.io coupon service to fetch and store coupon discounts. The goal is to integrate a web service call to Coupon.io's REST API upon item addition to the cart, store the fetched discount data, and reflect it in the user interface.

---

**Analysis**

To design the integration of the Coupon.io web service, the following logic should be implemented:

1. **Initiate Web Service Call**: When an item is added to the shopping cart, an asynchronous web service call should be made to the Coupon.io REST API using the product ID and currency to avoid blocking the main thread.
   
2. **Handle Response**: Process the response from the API to capture the discount amount and coupon code.
   
3. **Store Data**: Store the coupon information in the database associated with the cart item.
   
This integration involves changes to several parts of the codebase to ensure the web service call is made efficiently and data is stored correctly.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **Initiate Web Service Call**

   **File:** `oscar/apps/basket/views.py`
   - In the function that handles adding items to the cart, import the `requests` library alongside `concurrent.futures` for asynchronous processing.
   - Extract the required information (`product_id` and `currency`) from the cart item.
   - Create a helper function to encapsulate the API call logic, making a GET request to `https://coupon.io/:product_id?currency`.
   - Parse the JSON response to extract `discount_amount` and `coupon_code`.

2. **Handle Response**

   **File:** `oscar/apps/basket/views.py`
   - Use the extracted data from the web service response to update the cart item within the view function.
   - Add a call to the helper function using an asynchronous executor (for example, `ThreadPoolExecutor`).

3. **Store Data**

   **File:** `oscar/apps/basket/models.py`
   - Modify the `BasketLine` model to include fields for `coupon_amount` and `coupon_code`.
   - Update the model's `save` method to ensure these new fields are populated with the appropriate data when an item is added to the cart.

4. **Reflect in UI**

   **File:** `oscar/templates/basket/partials/line.html`
   - Update the template to display the coupon discount amount along with the item details in the shopping cart.
   - Ensure the UI elements correctly display the coupon code and discount in the specified currency.

Following these steps will ensure a robust integration of the Coupon.io coupon service with the shopping cart functionality, providing enhanced user experience through real-time coupon application.
